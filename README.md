This is my first project in Kotlin; it's a dice roller with 6 different sides. You should be able to see 3 sides at once every time you hit "roll".

In order to run this program, you would need to install Android Studio first. 

Here is the link: https://developer.android.com/studio

For my project, I wanted to have 2 dices rolling at the same time. In order to do that, I created a second state variable to store the result of the second dice. Then, I used that new state vairable to determine the image resource for the second dice.
