This is my first project in Kotlin; it's a dice roller with 6 different sides. You should be able to see 3 sides at once every time you hit "roll".

In order to run this program, you would need to install Android Studio first. 

Here is the link: https://developer.android.com/studio

I will be updating this program so that there are two dices appearing on the screen instead of just one.
